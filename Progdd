## Run dd in the background and save it's PID in the pid variable. Increase the bs if needed.
## Replace the "source" and "destination" of course!

dd if=source of=destination bs=4M & pid=$!

## It should give you your shell back. When it does, run the code below.
while ((pid)); do kill -USR1 "$pid" 2>/dev/null || break; sleep 5; done

## OR
until ((! pid)); do kill -USR1 "$pid" 2>/dev/null || break; sleep 5; done

## The while/until loop check's if "$pid" is not empty, then run kill every 5 seconds.
## Run 'dd --help | tail -n 19' for some info about the kill part.
## Question: Why do i have to do that when i can install dd_rescue or pv so i can have some fancy output?
## Answer: If your doing some rescue/saving your system using some limited tools, then good luck guessing when will it finish!
## Other than that... just sit back, watch and enjoy!

# Where source can be /dev/sd* or *iso
# Destination ca be *.iso *.img etc.

dd if=$1 of=$2 bs=4M & pid=$!

Progdd(){
  while ((pid)); do
    kill -USR1 "$pid" 2>/dev/null || break
    sleep 5
  done
}
